We’ve been trying to resolve this for several months, as we want to ensure we have a designated space that doesn’t obstruct site works or affect other residents.

The first time we had a visitor in 2021 (the blue car pictured in an earlier email), it became clear that the space allocated to us (Space 10) wasn’t suitable for parking. When we raised this with the developer at the time, Michael Hammill, an agreement was made that we could use the second bay on the right through the arch (Space 6). We were advised that once the development was completed, we would be assigned a suitable permanent space.
