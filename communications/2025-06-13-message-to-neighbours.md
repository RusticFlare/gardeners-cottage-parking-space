Hi 👋 it’s James & Jess from Gardeners Cottage (Chelmsford Mews)

You may have noticed the car is parked in the courtyard today. Sorry if this has caused any inconvenience. We got back last night to find a “Coach House use only” sign had been put up in the parking space we’ve been using (with permission) for the last few years.

We’re currently trying to get in touch with the owners of the Chelmsford Mews development to sort out a long-term solution. 

In the meantime I’m keeping track of everything here: https://rusticflare.github.io/gardeners-cottage-parking-space/

This has come at a difficult time because Jess’s mum will be staying with us while recovering from surgery for a brain tumour, so it’s especially important we have somewhere to park that doesn’t cause issues for anyone else.

Please let us know if you have any questions and thank you for your understanding!
