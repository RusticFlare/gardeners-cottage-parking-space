Hello,

Please can you put us in touch with the owners of the Chelmsford Mews/Howard Street/Fishergate/Fulford Road development?

Thank you,<br>
James and Jess

For context:

When we bought Gardeners Cottage in 2020, the parking space in front of The Coach House (Space A) was in the deeds to the property.

Upon moving in, it became clear that Space A is too small to be a parking space, as it restricts access through the arch. Because of this, the management company at the time gave us permission to use the second space on the right after you head through the arch (Space B).

We’ve been parking in Space B ever since, without issue.

It’s recently come to our attention that Space B has now been allocated to The Coach House, which means we no longer have access to it.

As a result, we’ve had no choice but to go back to using Space A, even though we’re fully aware it causes an obstruction. We’re doing this out of necessity, and wanted to explain the situation clearly so everyone is aware.

We are actively trying to resolve this, but in the meantime we appreciate everyone’s understanding.
